# FlowFM Inspector - Inspect and modify D-FlowFM files
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/mwtegelaers/FlowFM%20Inspector/_apis/build/status/BeardedPlatypus.FlowFM-Inspector?branchName=refs%2Fpull%2F9%2Fmerge)](https://dev.azure.com/mwtegelaers/FlowFM%20Inspector/_build/latest?definitionId=34&branchName=refs%2Fpull%2F9%2Fmerge)

The FlowFM Inspector is a small tool used to load, inspect, and modify
[Delft3D Flexible Mesh Suite files][D-FlowFM]. It leverages the [HYDROLIB-core][HYDROLIB]
for parsing and validation. It uses [React][React], [Gatsby.js][Gatsby], [Bulma][Bulma] 
and [Edge Webview 2][Webview2] to render the user interface, and the [FastAPI][FastAPI] library
to expose the [HYDROLIB-core][HYDROLIB] library to the user interface.

## Motivation - Learning React, Typescript, Gatsby.js

This is a personal project. The main goal for me is to learn React, TypeScript, and 
Gatsby.JS. As such, this should not be seen as a production ready tool (nor will it be
for the foreseeable future). Given that this is my first React project, the codebase 
itself is most likely riddled with bad practices and bugs, and as such should not be
used as a reference.
